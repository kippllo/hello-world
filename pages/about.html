			<h1>Your wait is over . . .</h1>

			<p class="cubeFirst">In the fall of 2000 an aggressive project was undertaken to completely automate the Northeast Texas Restitution Center in Maud, Texas. Using the most current application development techniques, Sentry Soft Solutions worked with the staff of NTRC to produce this user-friendly management software. 
			<br><br><br> This software actually freed the staff to supervise residents while easily capturing resident data for ease of manipulation in quick, easily retrieved, useful and productive formats. With the integration of several levels of security, this multi-sensitive resident data is available to authorized eyes only.</p>

			<p class="cube"> <span class="standOut">Now, this software is affordably priced and available to you.</span>
			<br><br> From the moment a resident walks in your door to the day he or she leaves, Resident Sentry helps to make their stay a successful one. With several levels of security, the resident's personal information is just a click away from authorized staff. Community service time is accurately tracked and all financial matters are handled with integrity and ease.
			<br><br>Virtually all resident data is stored and retrieved electronically.</p>

			<p class="cube"> When an initial release of this package was previewed at the TARSP Convention in Corpus Christi, Texas, one director sighed, I've been waiting for this for over 10 years. Another simply stated,   This is spectacular!</p>

			<p class="cube"> Your wait is over. Call today for a free, no obligation online demonstration of the most powerful Community Corrections and Treatment Program Management software available.</p>
